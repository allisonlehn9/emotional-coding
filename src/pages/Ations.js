            <h1>Frustrations, Explorations, and Aspirations</h1>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    When I was in middle and high school, I ran cross country—the obvious sport for masochistic, insanely stubborn people. 
                    I had this t-shirt with the quote “QUITTING IS UNACCEPTABLE” written in all caps in the Nike font, and that was essentially 
                    my one guiding principle in that godforsaken sport. In my first ever race (in 110°F heat, no less), I genuinely was on the 
                    brink of losing consciousness as soon as I crossed the finish line, and I had to be bathed in icy rags under a tent for half 
                    an hour. I got second place, though, so I didn't see a need to make any modifications to my unsustainable racing strategy. 
                    When I inevitably did quit a race—hyperventilating and on the verge of tears—the instant relief that came with dropping out 
                    was just as quickly replaced by immense shame. Even though I wasn’t the absolute fastest runner in the world, I thought that 
                    I could make up for it by being the most <i>determined</i> runner in the world. Now, at any point, did I stop to consider if 
                    it was reasonable to expect myself to perform at my peak while I was iron deficient, dehydrated, and getting at most six hours 
                    of sleep every day? Not a chance. Instead, my entire self-worth crumbled, and I never let it happen again. My greatest 
                    accomplishments in the sport thereafter were the times when they almost had to call me an ambulance
                    <Footnote num="1" text="I remember once blurrily believing that I might die right where I was, collapsed on the finish line, 
                        but I didn’t want to make anyone nervous, so I kept making jokes to the paramedics and my mom. I think that says enough 
                        about who I was back then."/>
                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyways, it’s been years since I’ve run consistently, and I’ve had plenty of time to realize how insane I was back then. Most 
                    importantly, I’ve recognized that quitting is not only acceptable, but knowing when to let go of certain aspirations can be a 
                    strength. There’s a blurry line between what we typically call “giving up” and the savvy business strategy of avoiding the sunk-cost 
                    fallacy: when your investments aren’t serving you, and there’s no indication that they will anytime soon, abandoning them really is 
                    the most rational move. Nevertheless, it’s still very difficult to relinquish that moral judgment I have against quitting. Perhaps 
                    it’s the woman-in-STEM instinct in me that’s always felt the need to prove that I was strong enough, smart enough, and overall good 
                    enough to handle any task, even the most futile ones that aren’t even worth the effort. Recognizing that I don’t have to prove anything 
                    to anyone—including myself—has been equal parts challenging and liberating.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The projects that I’ve presented here thus far have been evidence of this struggle that I’ve had with adopting this new mentality. Deciding 
                    to create a project composed of several smaller ones was a strategy I put in place in order to give myself space to explore multiple ideas and, 
                    when necessary, pivot. To give a sense of how far I’ve pivoted over time, this project was originally supposed to be a data journalism portfolio 
                    with three items: a project that used a map, another that included a mini video game, and a final one that utilized the Twitter API. As you can 
                    see, not only have the actual products shifted quite a bit, but the running thread between all of them—emotional coding—had yet to be established. 
                    The ideas and themes of this portfolio emerged from the actual process of its creation, which included not only the completed work seen here, but 
                    many other abandoned, small-scale, and postponed ideas along the way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As part of my reflection on all of these “failures,” I’ve come to the conclusion that it would be disingenuous to present this work without showing 
                    the complete narrative of my process, which includes all of these things that didn’t make the cut. Not only does it present a more transparent picture 
                    of the effort that went into developing all of this work, but it also might help advise others to not waste their time on certain missteps that I made 
                    along the way
                    <Footnote num="2" text={<div>This project is also inspired by the work of my good friend Ingrid, who is developing a <Link text="Capstone Graveyard" 
                    href="https://capstone-graveyard0.web.app/home" /> for people to dump their unused project ideas for others that struggle with inspiration.</div>}/>
                    . It feels wrong to think of these “failed projects” or “things I quit,” since they still carry all of that judgment I’m trying to shake out. Instead, 
                    I’ve decided to call these projects the three <i>-ations</i>: frustrations, explorations, and aspirations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <b>frustrations</b> are the projects that I needed to give up on in order to not go insane. They typically required skills or technologies that 
                    weren’t as accessible, understandable, or functional as I had hoped they would be. I put in as much effort as I could, but once I reached a point where 
                    it was more frustrating than enjoyable to work on the project, I dropped them in favor of something else.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <b>explorations</b> are the smaller-scale projects that I did in order to explore new techniques and technologies. They’re not quite big or interesting 
                    enough to present on their own—although they might be iterated upon to become bigger and more interesting—but it was never their purpose to be bigger than 
                    they are at the moment. I needed to experiment with many different techniques as a part of this process, and it made much more sense to work on a limited 
                    scale in order to avoid spending too much time on an inevitable frustration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, the <b>aspirations</b> are projects that I plan to start or finish in the future. These ideas need additional refinement with the dedication of more 
                    time, skills, or resources than I currently possess. Instead of putting on the pressure to execute all of these ideas at this instant, I hope that letting them 
                    simmer will eventually lead to better, less-rushed projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It’s perhaps most useful to consider these in context, so let’s explore the role of each of the <i>-ations</i> in my overall process.

                </p>
            </div>
            <h2>Frustrations</h2>
            <p>
                In breaking down each of the projects that turned out to be frustrations, I found the following four aspects of it to be the most noteworthy: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Context:</b> What’s the backstory behind this idea? Under what conditions and aspirations did it emerge?</li>
                <li><b>Concept:</b> What actual project did I try to execute based on this idea?</li>
                <li><b>Point of Frustration:</b> At what point did I abandon the concept? What caused the frustration?</li>
                <li><b>Pivot:</b> How did I change direction from this initial idea? Did it shift into a different concept, or inspire an entirely new direction?</li>
            </ul>

 
            <h2>Explorations</h2>
            <p>
                The explorations are projects that I saw through to their completion, but their general scope was too small-scale to really count as an entire portfolio item. Similar to the frustrations, I’ve broken them down to the following three points:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Context:</b> What’s the backstory behind this idea? Under what conditions and aspirations did it emerge?</li>
                <li><b>Concept:</b> What actual project did I successfully execute based on this idea?</li>
                <li><b>Continuation:</b> What projects did I do as a result of the practice I got with these? How could they be expanded to become full-scale projects?</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Aspirations</h2>
            <p>
            The aspirations are the ideas that, due to some practical reason for being unable to execute them in the present, I’ve shelved them for the future. I’ll be analyzing them according to the following points:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Context:</b> What’s the backstory behind this idea? Under what conditions and aspirations did it emerge?</li>
                <li><b>Concept:</b> What actual project did I intend to execute based on this idea?</li>
                <li><b>Postponement:</b> Why wasn’t I able to complete this idea? What’s my plan for working on it in the future?</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                There’s a world of difference between who I was when I stepped out of that cross country race on a random Thursday in high school and the person I am today. 
                I’ve come to recognize that just because I cannot possibly do every single thing I’ve ever set my mind to does <i>not</i> mean that I’m not an intelligent, 
                capable, and motivated person. In fact, the resilience that I embody today, grounded in mindful flexibility rather than blind persistence, is much stronger 
                than it ever was. By taking care of myself mentally, accepting my setbacks and understanding how to grow from them, I’m able to handle more work with intrinsic 
                enthusiasm, not just an internal dictatorial regime as motivation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Carefully documenting these <i>-ations</i> in my process helped me really come to terms with all of the unrecognized work that was necessary to create what I 
                would define as a successful project. Reclaiming these as not failures, but necessary steps, has helped me value myself and my labor beyond what gets put on 
                the final page. For those among us that put too much pressure on ourselves to only present the things that we do perfectly, I encourage you to start sharing 
                your mistakes with the world. Not only did organizing my thoughts with this three three <i>-ations</i> structure help me appreciate my own progress and validate 
                exploratory effort spent in ways that aren’t immediately productive, sharing these results will also help combat the systems around us that only seem to reward 
                perpetual, outward-facing success.
