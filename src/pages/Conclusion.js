            <p>
                It’s impossible for me to describe how transformative the concept of emotional coding has 
                been for me, but I’m going to do my very best to try. The process of writing about all of 
                this work I’ve done in the past year has brought me to tears on multiple occasions—this 
                time for the right reasons. It’s hard to notice yourself growing out of insecurities, 
                climbing out of holes of self-despair, and beginning to completely love yourself on a day-to-day 
                basis, but when I look back on how absolutely burnt out and upset that I used to feel, I’m overwhelmed 
                with gratitude for how genuinely <i>happy</i> I feel now. 
            </p>
            <p>
                That gratitude has seeped over into so many other aspects of my life. Since I’ve given myself the 
                space to approach computer science on my own terms, I have the ability to share so much more of 
                myself with the people that supported me when I was at my worst. I’ve sent out so many messages to 
                friends that were there for me when I had no idea how to accept their help, trying my best to thank 
                them completely, this time. I used to feel like relying upon others made me a liability, indebted to 
                people in ways I could never pay back, but now that I recognize my strength comes from my ability to 
                support and be supported by others.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was the ethics of care framework, and the way I shaped it into my very own idea of emotional coding, 
                that helped me reclaim my relationship with computer science. More so than ever, I genuinely believe that 
                it’s a field in which I not only belong, but have so much to offer. This body of work demonstrates not only 
                my technical prowess, but also the additional value that comes from emotionally embodied and relationship-centered 
                work. Above all else, I want this concept to permeate the field. I know that sharing my experience will help 
                all of the other people that were equally scarred by their experiences with coding and data, encouraging them 
                to reassert their own personal value and abilities to themselves and the world around them. We all benefit from 
                the incorporation of additional empowered perspectives within the industry—and the world at large.

                Looking back more specifically on the products I’ve compiled here, I’m incredibly proud of all that they represent. 
                My work on the <Link text="Colombia Periodical Licenses Map" href="/Colombia-Periodical-Licenses-Map" /> taught me 
                about the nuances of working with archives, difficult datasets, and digital interfaces. It helped me fully put into 
                practice what it means to do work <i>for and with the public,</i> and I take the strategies and considerations I put into place 
                then with me everywhere I go. <Link text="RuPaul’s Machine Learning Race" href="/RuPauls-Machine-Learning-Race" /> allowed 
                me to transition from the worst student in the class to a teacher with the most complete understanding of what it means to 
                make content intelligible. Everyone was amused that I found a way to incorporate <i>Drag Race</i> into this project, but 
                I think the lack of seriousness surrounding this whole concept makes the whole thing even more meaningful: the work we do 
                should reflect the things we care about, from beginner-friendly instruction to queer joy. Assembling this <Link text="Portfolio Website" href="/Portfolio-Website" /> was 
                another major milestone for me in reclaiming my own learning pace, and understanding that, while at times I need space to 
                explore things on my own, it’s impossible to ignore the role that friendships and community support play in our respective 
                educational journeys. And, finally, reframing my failures, missteps, and waste-of-time projects as crucial steps in my process 
                has helped me recognize the importance of having some <Link text="Frustrations, Explorations, and Aspirations" href="/Frustrations-Explorations-Aspirations" /> to 
                accompany my journey to whatever I define as success. The flexibility and forgiveness that it has inspired in me has resulted in 
                me being so much kinder to myself.
            </p>
            <p>
                We’re all on our own paths, and the technical and emotional journey that I’ve documented here will be distinct from everyone else’s 
                experience. However, if this work leaves any singular impression, I hope that it’s the idea that being an emotional coder is not only 
                valid, but something to aspire to. The more we marinate our work within our own experience and the relationships we share with others, 
                the more we start to create a technical world that actually cares for the people that live within it—and that’s a world that I would 
                like to live in.
